Machine Learning Model development


### Prediction Model
- Models are developed based on RNN using the LSTM model for the prediction of stocks.

### Data Storage for scripts
- The format for the data will be in (.csv).
- Using Mega cloud storage we will access the cloud storage and store our scripts 5 years of data.
- For excessing the API we have to use the Mega.py library which will identify the format and upload the file to the mega storage.
